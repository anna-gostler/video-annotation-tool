# Video Annotation Tool
This web application allows the user to annotate the position of an object in every frame of a video.

The user can:
* manually mark the object by dragging and resizing a bounding box 
* run a video tracker (CSRT) that automatically suggests bounding boxes and stops when it fails to track the target  
* correct bounding boxes in previously annotated frames
